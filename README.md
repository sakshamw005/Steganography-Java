Image Steganography in Java

Overview

This project demonstrates an Image Steganography tool implemented in Java, which allows users to embed secret messages within images for secure communication. The application provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that lets users easily encrypt and decrypt hidden messages within image files using a passcode for added security. This project is an excellent example of how Java can be used for image manipulation and data security.

Features

Encrypt and Decrypt Messages: Hide and retrieve secret messages inside images.

GUI Interface: Simple and user-friendly interface built with Java Swing.

Passcode Protection: Secure encryption and decryption using a passcode.

Cross-Platform Support: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Image File Support: Works with standard image formats like JPG.

Real-Time Status Updates: Displays status messages during the encryption and decryption process.
